Code Review Checklist Client:A leading game development firm in the USA Industry Type:Gaming Software Products & Services:Gaming Software Development Organization Size:200+ Our client sends records of millions of sports bets in real time from all over the world via an API. These bets are recorded in MySQL servers. We are tasked with processing and calculating the expected Profit and Loss (PNL) as per the bets records for each sport. Our goal is to analyze these records in real time via API and calculate PNL as per the game records history provided via API. This requires building a serverless application in Python (or similar) that reads all bets records and updates PNL in real time (within milliseconds, records need to be updated). The application should be capable of handling 10,000+ records of bets per second for numbers of different games, with PNL needing to be updated for each game separately. To address this problem, we propose developing a Python-based serverless application that leverages machine learning models for real-time PNL calculation. The application will use the MySQL database to store and retrieve betting records. It will employ parallel computing techniques to ensure efficient processing of high volumes of data. The application will also utilize APIs to fetch real-time data and update PNL accordingly. The application will follow these steps:  The implementation of the proposed Python-based serverless application for real-time PNL calculation had significant positive impacts on our business operations. Firstly, the application enabled us to process and analyze millions of sports bets in real time, enhancing our decision-making capabilities and allowing for quicker responses to changes in the betting market. This improved our ability to predict outcomes and adjust our betting strategies accordingly. Secondly, the application significantly reduced the time taken to calculate PNL, from hours to mere minutes. This resulted in faster decision-making processes and timely financial reporting, which were crucial for our clients and investors. Lastly, the application’s ability to handle high volumes of data and provide real-time updates facilitated a more globalized betting market. With real-time data and digital platforms, geographical boundaries became less relevant, allowing bettors from around the world to place bets on any event globally, with real-time odds reflecting local nuances and dynamics. This led to increased liquidity and more competitive odds. Overall, the successful implementation of the application led to a more efficient, accurate, and timely PNL calculation process, resulting in improved business performance and customer satisfaction.
