Code Review Checklist Client:A leading tech firm in the USA Industry Type:IT Services:SaaS, Products Organization Size:100+ The goal of this task is to create and implement a workflow that annotates People/Places/Organizations and assigns them a specific number (from a normdatabase). The NER-Task should be done by using Bert (NER-Germanhttps://huggingface.co/flair/ner-germanor something similar). The input to this first task is a text in XML-Format. It is important that the structuring text is not altered by the NER. This could be possible by tokenizing the XML-elements in a different/seperate way, to then run the NER with BERT and afterwards add the elements afterwards at the exact position where the initially were. The tags that were added by the NER than can be easily replaced with the required tags in the XML-format.
