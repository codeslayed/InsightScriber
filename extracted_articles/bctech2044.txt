Mapping the values in make.com from Monday.com2. Whenever the update is generated on Monday.com, a new row is added to the Google sheet. 3. Extracting insights from the data To solve the technical challenges, we provided following solutions as follow:1. For mapping the values from Monday.com to make.com, we got access as admin to reach out the columns id on Monday.com. 2. On make.com, we created multiple models linking each other based on the row id in the google sheet. 3. After completing the data integration, we use calculations to extract meaningful insights from the data. Using this dashboard, a client can keep track of the employee’s work process. So he can analyze employee workflow nature.
