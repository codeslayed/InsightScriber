Code Review Checklist Client:A leading tech firm in Europe Industry Type:IT Products & Services:IT & Consulting, Software Development Organization Size:1000+ Our company requires a robust, scalable, and secure data integration solution that can handle thousands of connections. We need to develop Airbyte connectors for various software applications listed in 2-nx-integration, including Join Portal, ClickUp, Coach Accountable, Hubspot, Quickbooks, Quickbooks Time, and Sales Flow. These connectors should be developed in Python and then wrapped into Docker images. The code should be housed in GitHub and automatically applied to Airbyte for execution using a CI/CD pipeline from GitHub to Airbyte. We also need a full production-ready version of Airbyte hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes, secured via Google Sign In. Moreover, we want to add custom features to Airbyte to control BigQuery projects/datasets. Both Airbyte and BigQuery should be monitored via Sentry, which will also be housed/hosted in the same project for all error reporting/monitoring. We also need to develop transformations to clean and transform the data from the software source to the client’s GCP Project for BigQuery. The code for these transformations should be stored in GitHub. We propose to develop an instance of Airbyte that is production-ready on GCP over Kubernetes. This will be secured using Google Sign On linked to our organization. We will deploy Airbyte using the official documentation 8. To secure the Kubernetes setup, we plan to use Traefik’s ForwardAuth feature. Next, we will code Airbyte Python integrations for our needed software list. We have already gathered the API documentation for each software application and have started coding the integrations. Once the initial integration is complete, we will document the process in ClickUp to guide future integrations. We will use GitHub to host both the source code and Docker images of Airbyte integrations. We will also use Google Cloud’s Sentry for error reporting and monitoring.  By developing a robust and scalable data integration solution using Airbyte, we aim to significantly enhance our business operations. This solution will enable us to efficiently manage and analyze data from various software applications, leading to improved decision-making processes. Firstly, the ability to extract and load data from different software applications will allow us to centralize our data management, reducing the complexity of handling multiple data sources. This will streamline our data analysis processes and provide a unified view of our business data. Secondly, the scalability of our solution means that it can handle a growing volume of data as our business grows. This is crucial in today’s digital age where businesses generate vast amounts of data daily. Lastly, by securing our data integration solution with Google Sign In, we can ensure that only authorized individuals can access our sensitive business data. This adds an extra layer of security to our data management practices and helps protect against potential data breaches. Moreover, by using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for hosting our solution, we can take advantage of its advanced features and robust infrastructure. This will further enhance the reliability and performance of our data integration solution. Overall, implementing this solution will enable us to harness the power of data to drive our business growth and success   Summarized: https://blackcoffer.com/ This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.
