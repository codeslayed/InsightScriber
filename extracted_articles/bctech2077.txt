Code Review Checklist Client:A leading tech firm in Newzealand Industry Type:Retail Services:Retail business Organization Size:100+ Brodie Johnco had a MongoDB Database that he wanted to connect to a Power BI Dashboard. However, ODBC connectors were not working for his level of subscription, so he needed a cheaper workaround. Brodie Johnco had a MongoDB Database containing a large amount of data that he wanted to visualize in a Power BI Dashboard. He initially tried to use ODBC connectors to connect his database to Power BI, but ran into issues due to his level of subscription. We were brought in to help find a cheaper workaround. Our solution involved using Python to extract the relevant data from Brodie’s MongoDB Database. We used the Pandas library to create Dataframes, which we then uploaded to Azure Blob Storage as tables. We set up an Azure pipeline that ran a Python script every 30 minutes to update the tables with new data from the database. We used Brodie’s MongoDB Database keys to extract relevant Data Clusters as Pandas Dataframes. We then added them as tables to Azure Blob Storage and set up a Python script to an Azure pipeline that refreshed every 30 minutes. This allowed us to keep the data in sync and provide Brodie with up-to-date information for his Power BI Dashboard. The final deliverable was a readable CSV file that contained the converted data from the original JSON format.

We overcame this challenge by using Python and Azure Blob Storage to extract and store the relevant data. Our solution allowed Brodie to visualize his data in a Power BI Dashboard without having to pay for expensive ODBC connectors. The Azure Blob Storage solution we implemented was much more cost-effective and provided him with up-to-date information every 30 minutes. https://github.com/AjayBidyarthy/Brodie-Johnco We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.
