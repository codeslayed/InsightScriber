Code Review Checklist Client:A leading tech firm in Europe Industry Type:IT Services:IT and Consulting Organization Size:100+ The client’s object was to create AI agents for his website, which the end-users will utilize for many tasks. The client had some recommendations on the models are utilized. Created a feasible models list that complements the client’s requirement and when ahead and executed the Executor code for every model for compatibility with JinaAI deployment. After implementing Executor codes, I created a Flow to connect every executor and deployed it successfully.
