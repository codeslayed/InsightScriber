Code Review Checklist Client:A leading retail firm in the USA Industry Type:Retail Products & Services:Retail Business, e-commerce Organization Size:100+ To develop an ETL discovery tool that can answer the queries related to ETL pipelines in conversational format. The areas of the concerned queries should include Environment Analysis, Workflow Analysis, Data Source and Target Mapping, Transformation Logic, Data Volume and Velocity, Error Handling and Logging and Security and Access Control. In developing our solution, we began by aggregating Open-Source Generic ETL Tool Code from various repositories on GitHub and other relevant sources. Subsequently, we meticulously fine-tuned the collected ETL tool code, organizing and saving it into distinct folders, each containing different ETL pipelines. Following this, we implemented an OpenAI Assistant, integrating it with all the refined ETL pipelines. To facilitate communication with these pipelines, we employed the OpenAI Assistant ID within our Flask API. For the user interface, we opted for a Streamlit front-end, providing a seamless and user-friendly interaction with our OpenAI Assistant and the integrated ETL pipelines. ETL Discovery Tool serves as the core engine for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations. It is designed to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks efficiently. It will be used for training the OpenAI model on the ETL Discovery tools. Step 1.Open-Source Generic ETL Tool Code: The Open-Source Generic ETL Tool serves as the core engine for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations. It is designed to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks efficiently. It will be used for training the OpenAI model on the ETL Discovery tools. Step 2.Data Cleaning: Data Cleaning is a critical stage that involves cleansing and pre-processing raw data to enhance its quality and integrity. In this step the ETL understands the expected data format that is organized and cleaned for uniformity of data. Step 3.Files/DB Represents the storage or databases utilized for storing processed data. In this step, solutions for processed data the code files will be arranged and catalogued so that they are ready to be used by the OpenAI Assistants API. Step 4.OpenAI Assistant Creation via API: This step involves creating an OpenAI Assistant using the OpenAI API. Step 5.OpenAI Assistant: In this step, the Assistant that is created from previous step will be queried by the API with instructions for the context accommodation. Step 6.Django/Flask/FastAPI API: This step involves setting up an API using popular frameworks like Django, Flask, or FastAPI. Step 7.Chat Frontend (Streamlit): Represents the user interface for interacting with the system, built using Streamlit. Finding the ETL pipelines and fine tuning the ETL pipelines Our approach to overcoming technical challenges involved an extensive internet search focused on ETL pipelines. We scoured various online resources, eventually identifying the most effective ETL pipelines available on GitHub. To address each challenge systematically, we created individual files for each ETL pipeline. In the process, we meticulously fine-tuned and optimized each pipeline, documenting the specific tasks and functions within the respective files. This approach allowed us to provide detailed descriptions of the work performed for every ETL pipeline, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the solutions implemented to tackle the technical hurdles encountered. The business impact was substantial as the client efficiently analysed numerous ETL tool pipelines. Instant answers in a chat format replaced the time-consuming manual work that could take Data Engineers days or weeks. This streamlined process significantly enhanced productivity and responsiveness, reflecting a tangible improvement in operational efficiency for the client.
